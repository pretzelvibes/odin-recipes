    <p>These French onion burgers are made with a simple combination of ground beef and onion soup mix, then topped with Havarti cheese, onions, and mushrooms.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>12 slices havarti cheese</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Place hamburger bun halves, cut-sides down, in the hot skillet until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove toasted buns to a plate.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat on the grill. Add mushrooms and onions; season with salt and black pepper and cook and stir until mushrooms are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix ground beef and onion soup mix in a bowl using your hands. Form mixture into 6 hamburger patties.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil grill grates. Grill burgers for about 5 minutes, then flip and grill to your desired doneness. A meat thermometer inserted near the center of patties should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove burgers from heat to rest for 5 minutes. Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, and add burgers; divide mushrooms and onions between burgers to serve.</li>
    </ol>
